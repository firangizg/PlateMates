        <h1>Hi! Welcome to PlateMates!</h1>
        <h3>To connect new [“professionals”/ “relocators”/”movers”] through a love of shared food.</h3>
        <p> We all love to eat, and shared meals are one of our favorite ways to catch up and enjoy time together. Shared meals are also a great way to get to know new friends and form new connections. Recently, one of our team members started developing a friendship with a mutual friend, but soon found out that they had very different opinions when it came to food. Our foodie teammate found it hard to plan hangouts with this friend, as they had so little in common. So, PlateMates was born.
