# PlateMates

On PlateMates, users first create a profile with a few of their food preferences. Using this data, PlateMates suggests nearby restaurants to the user, who can then mark whether they are or are not interested in the restaurants. When three or more users mark that they are interested in a specific restaurant within a 24-hour timespan, they are all notified, and are then able to join a chat together to plan a meetup at this restaurant. In the chat, users can create polls and calendar events. Additionally, community events involving food are featured on PlateMates.

The Figma prototype [here](https://www.figma.com/file/CdR4F6RKYz5jdHpptHgmum/PlateMates?node-id=0%3A1) demonstrates the vision behind this project. 

The short video [here](https://youtu.be/_G6a44CM8xc) shows one aspect of the app that could translate well to a web app.
